## About This Repository

This repository contains scalable, production-focused automation scripts designed to solve real-world Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Entra ID challenges.

The goal of this project is to provide:

- Reliable automation solutions
- Performance-optimized Microsoft Graph API usage
- Governance-driven device management tools
- Scalable enterprise-ready scripting examples
- Practical solutions for MSP and enterprise environments

All scripts are written with performance, logging, safety controls, and responsible production deployment in mind.

## Featured Script

### Intune Primary User Auto-Assignment & Shared Device Correction

Automatically manages the **Primary User** field in Microsoft Intune based on Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) sign-in activity.

---

## Key Features

- Automatically assigns Primary User for single-user devices  
- Automatically removes Primary User for shared devices  
- Clears stale ownership assignments  
- Detects multiple-user logins within a defined timeframe  
- **Supports user exclusion logic**:
  - Skip specific user accounts
  - Skip users based on partial username matching
  - Skip entire Azure AD groups
- Excluded users are ignored during ownership evaluation
- Optimized Microsoft Graph batching
- Configurable device processing limits
- Timestamped logging with automatic retention trimming
- Optional failure email notifications
- Report, Test, and Live execution modes
- Designed for scheduled automation (hourly or daily)

---

## Enhanced Ownership Logic

The script now includes intelligent exclusion handling to prevent service accounts, administrative identities, or exception users from incorrectly becoming Primary Users.

Behavior examples:

- If **two users** sign in and **one is excluded**, the remaining eligible user will be assigned as the Primary User.
- If **three users** sign in and **one is excluded**, the device will still be classified as **shared**, because multiple eligible users remain.
- If only excluded users sign in, no changes are made.

Excluded accounts are removed from consideration before device classification occurs.

This ensures accurate ownership determination while maintaining governance controls.

---

## Why This Matters

Primary User accuracy directly impacts:

- Intune reporting accuracy
- Compliance targeting
- Conditional Access insights
- Asset ownership tracking
- Windows Autopilot reporting
- License alignment
- Governance integrity

In large or fast-moving environments, ownership drift is inevitable.  
This automation continuously realigns ownership based on real user behavior.
